# Methane-Emission-Index

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of feature importance selection methods aimed at identifying the key drivers of methane emissions globally. We identify 8 critical features among 58  contributing most to methane emissions. In addition, we apply four machine learning models, Support Vector Machine, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest, to estimate methane level across various countries. Moreover, we determine and anlayze the local and global trend for methane emission across 220 countries and identify the top countries that have the steadiest and the most decrease as well the most increase in methane emission in the recent 30 years.
