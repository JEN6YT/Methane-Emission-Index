# Methane-Emission-Index

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of feature importance selection
methods aimed at identifying the key drivers of methane emissions globally. We
identify eight critical features contributing to methane emissions. In addition, we
apply four machine learning models, Support Vector Machine, LightGBM, XG-
Boost, and Random Forest, to predict methane levels across various countries. Each
model undergoes extensive hyperparameter tuning, followed by a rigorous perform-
ance comparison. Our findings highlight that XGBoost consistently outperforms
the other models, demonstrating its robust predictive capabilities across diverse
contexts.
